# Figma Integration Plan

This document outlines the approach for integrating the Figma designs into the Dadson website.

## Integration Process

1. **Design Analysis**
   - Review the Figma designs to understand the overall design system
   - Identify reusable components and patterns
   - Note color schemes, typography, and spacing patterns

2. **Component Extraction**
   - Extract UI components from Figma designs
   - Create reusable React components based on the designs
   - Ensure consistency with the design system

3. **Progressive Implementation**
   - Implement designs page by page or component by component
   - Start with core sections of the homepage
   - Move to other pages once the design system is established

4. **Design Validation**
   - Compare implemented components with Figma designs
   - Ensure pixel-perfect alignment where possible
   - Make adjustments as needed

## Design System Implementation

### Colors
- Extract color values from Figma and implement in Tailwind config
- Create semantic color variables for consistency

### Typography
- Implement the font families specified in the design
- Set up consistent typography scales
- Create reusable text components if necessary

### Spacing
- Use Tailwind's spacing system to match the design's whitespace
- Create consistent spacing between elements

### Components
- Implement UI components according to the Figma design specs
- Ensure responsiveness across all breakpoints

## Responsive Design Implementation

- Implement responsive designs for all components
- Use breakpoints that match the Figma design frames
- Ensure designs work well on all device sizes

## Animation Strategy

- Identify elements that require animation from the Figma prototypes
- Implement animations using Framer Motion
- Ensure animations enhance the user experience without being distracting

## Feedback Loop

- Regular design reviews with stakeholders
- Document design decisions and deviations
- Iterate based on feedback

## Timeline

1. **Phase 1**: Core layout components and design system
2. **Phase 2**: Homepage implementation
3. **Phase 3**: Secondary pages implementation
4. **Phase 4**: Refinement and animation
5. **Phase 5**: Final review and adjustments

## Contact Page Special Considerations

- The contact page design is pending confirmation
- Once the design is finalized, integrate it into the website
- Implement form validation and submission logic

## Tools and Libraries

- **Figma API**: For automated asset extraction if needed
- **Tailwind CSS**: For implementing the design system
- **Framer Motion**: For animations
- **Headless UI**: For accessible interactive components
